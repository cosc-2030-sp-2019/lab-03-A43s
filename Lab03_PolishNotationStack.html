<h1>Lab 03: Polish Notation Stack</h1>

<p>Due March 4th at 7:00 p.m.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The stack ADT is useful for starting and suspending tasks while subordinate tasks are completed.</p>
<p>By the end of this lab, you will have a code repository in your files that contains the following deliverables:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>README.md</kbd></li>
<li><kbd><em>your-name</em>_HelpSheet.txt</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>PrefixPolish.py</kbd></li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the following files, either from GitHub lab03-stack or from the Lab Materials on WyoCourses, for today's lab:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<kbd>PostfixPolish.py</kbd>
</li>
<li>Study the implementation of the stack via the <em>List</em> data type in Python. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<ol>
<li>Examine, compile, and execute the code.</li>
<li>This program inserts at position 0.  A better implementation uses the back end of the stack as the "top", for push and pop purposes, using the list operator <kbd>append</kbd>.  See the Python Tutorial for that model, and change the code to do that.
<li>The standard Polish notation developed by the eminent mathematician Jan &#x0141;ukasiewicz puts the operator first, followed by the operands.  Now change your Python program to that prefix model&mdash;save it as <kbd>PrefixPolish.py</kb> to submit&dash;and evaluate the test expressions that way.</li>
<li>In the README file:
  Write the quadratic equation in both Polish Notation (prefix) and Reverse Polish Notation (postfix).</li>
<li>Add to your Help Sheet:  List the Python modules that you have imported in your Python experience, and what they contain. And answer this question:
What is the class of the ops variable?  (Review Ch. 5 of the Tutorial.)  And what are the other general-purpose built-in <em>container</em> data structures in Python?</li>
</ol>
